- 56 for the ground markers
- 15 for finding the nearest satellite
- 9 for trying to implement SGP4
- 10 for reformatting in the middle
- 44 for dijkstra and path finding
- 73 for chaning how the path is drawn and some other imporvements to that
- 35 for fixing the performance of the graph algorithms
- 41 updating the UI and some more fixes to path visualization
- 51 for final bug fixes, cleaning the code and adding comments
- Totals 477

**Total prompts: 760**
**Time: 29 hours, 40 minutes**

Majority of the problems in the beginning of improving the graph creation and routing algorithms, were caused by me not knowing how the code worked.

It gets increasingly more difficult to define which prompts are useful and which are not, as most of the prompts are not actually generating new code, but fixing old. There are some clear ones, where the code is clearly wrong, but most of the time even when the code did not work, some parts of it were used.
