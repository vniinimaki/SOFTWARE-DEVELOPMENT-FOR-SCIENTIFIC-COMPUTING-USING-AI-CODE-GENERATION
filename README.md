# LEO Satellite simulation using LLM code generation

### How to run the simulation locally:

1. **Install Node.js**: Before you begin, make sure you have Node.js installed on your system. If not, you can download and install it from [the official Node.js website](https://nodejs.org/).

2. **Access the Application Code**:
    - If you have Git installed, you can clone the application repository by running the following command in your terminal:
        ```bash
        git clone https://gitlab.com/vniinimaki/llm-assisted-development-project.git
        ```
    - Alternatively, you can download the application code as a ZIP file from the GitLab repository page and unzip it.

3. **Navigate to the Project Directory**: Once you have the application code on your machine, navigate to the project directory using your terminal.

4. **Install Dependencies**: Before running the application, you need to install its dependencies. Run the following command in your terminal:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

5. **Start the Application**: After installing the dependencies, you can start the application by running the following command:
